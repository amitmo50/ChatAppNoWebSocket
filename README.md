# Chat Application without WebSocket
    In this task I need to create Chat Application that communicate between persons, the app have two rooms: Room1 and Room2.
    The users can shift between the rooms by click on the "X" on the top right on the Chat Page and return to the Login Page and then enter to the other room.
    In this projet I implemented the Long Polling method to deal and reduce the too many request for the Server side by the Client side.

# To Run The Application Please Run The Follow Command
    npm run dev
    This will run both client and server side.
